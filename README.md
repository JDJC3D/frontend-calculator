Fork this repo so we can check out the code on your Github account.

- Build it as good as you can ðŸ˜‰
- You can not use any CSS/JavaScript Library or Framework
- Include a README.md with a nice explanation of how you build it and why you did it this way.
- If you want, you can use a CSS pre-processor (Sass/SCSS/Less/PostCSS)
- Use the structure in the repo

> I wish you good luck!
